Patrick J. Lohr completed his B.S. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Arizona in 2018 before beginning his graduate program in Chemical Engineering in 2019. As a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at the University of Arizona, Patrick is interested in the use of computational tools like Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) and classical molecular dynamics to characterize atomic-scale interactions between organic additives and metal halide perovskite semiconductors. Through the application of these techniques, Patrick aims to reveal key insights into nucleation, defect passivation, and quasi-2D heterostructure formation in perovskite films.

Patrick is a winner of the prestigious University Fellowship, which promotes engagement in outreach through mentorship and community engagement.

When not working, he enjoys traveling, hiking, reading, and playing drums and guitar.
