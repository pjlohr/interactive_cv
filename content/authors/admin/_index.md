Patrick J. Lohr completed his B.S. in Chemical Engineering at the University of Arizona in 2018 before joining the graduate program in Chemical Engineering in 2019. He worked with Dr Kim Ogden and the Sustainable Bioeconomy for Arid Regions (SBAR) project on the development of a predictive crop model for guayule biomass and rubber yield. As a Ph.D. student in the Department of Chemical and Environmental Engineering at the University of Arizona, Patrick is interested in using computational tools to better understand molecular interactions in perovskite precursor solutions and how these interactions affect crystallite growth and film formation.

Patrick is a winner of the prestigious University Fellowship, which promotes engagement in outreach through mentorship and community engagement.

When not working, he enjoys traveling, hiking, reading, and playing drums and guitar.
